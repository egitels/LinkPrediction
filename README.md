# LinkPrediction

An example of how to generate an edge list file from a text file:
python scripts/conversion_driver.py data/as-ph/1994.txt edge_lists/as-ph/1994.txt

All author extraction scripts are contained within the scripts folder. Look at the linkprediction folder for our implementation of link prediction algorithms.
